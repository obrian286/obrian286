## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**obrian286/obrian286** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a crypto token system (ai driven)
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning swiftlyui and Kotlin
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a small upcoming startup (can not disclose)
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with my own startup
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything business/tech related
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: instagram (_obryan._)
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: l think with the right help on my startup we can make millions or not surely l can not 
                gurantee success but anything is worth trying espacially from a 17 year old kid lol.
